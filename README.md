# flexbox-crash-course - This project to showcase a deeper understanding of flexbox and how to create a landing
page with a nav bar and different elements. At this point I am 62% of the way done with the first part of The Odin
Project. Understanding how to align and place my elements where I want them is crucial to building a modern layout 
and that is what I'm setting out to do with this landing page.
